# 🧠 My JavaScript Projects

This repository contains my personal work, experiments, and practice projects written in JavaScript.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a separate project or example. Inside, you may find:
- `index.html` – a basic HTML file to run the script
- `script.js` – the JavaScript code
- `style.css` – optional styling (if needed)
- `README.md` – a short description of the project (if available)

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo is a place for me to practice and explore JavaScript through various small projects and coding exercises.

## 📌 Note

These projects are for learning purposes and may evolve over time as I improve my skills.
